  "desc": "Exercise 0.4: Consider a simulation of paint splatter drawn as a collection of colored dots. Most of the paint clusters around a central position, but some dots splatter out toward the edges. Can you use a normal distribution of random numbers to generate the positions of the dots? Can you also use a normal distribution of random numbers to generate a color palette? Try creating a slider to adjust the standard deviation.",
